The world has failed. Not with a bang. Not with a whimper. Not even with a sigh. With a shrug of apathy the world has turned its back and slept until it died. Unnoticed by the universe but mourned by a few. We few. The morals. The meek. The explorers. And in noticing that death we have risen a new world from the old.

Some of what was lost has been found. Some new ideas have been brought forth from the aether. Some things wait to be found again. By you, our intrepid industrious individuals! You are the heart of this world. Your feet are the staccato beat of this world's pulse. Your pick axe blows are the clarion call that awaken this world.

Welcome to the new World! Kadath! A new dream that we will all share and shape! Your future has arrived, are you ready to go?

This Minecraft pack will be rolled out in stages (i.e. expannsion packs) as the weeks progress. We will try to keep with a theme, each one building on the last, to reach the final goal of a full and complete gaming experience. We've added in some new mods that change the way this world will interact with you and the ways that you interact with it.

The initial release:
This release is intended to be very basic in tech level, with steam power being the most advanced machines that can be created. There will be smelteries and foundries, coke ovens and blast furnaces, but no factories yet. That tech will need to be found before it can be given to the masses! Along with basic technology the magic of the land is also very basic and nature based. The power of nature, of the self, of blood is known and exploitable but more advanced thaumaturgy is beyond this world.

Starting off:
There are two changes that will affect you immediately. 1) Tinker Tweaks has been installed, which changes the way that tools are constructed, repaired, and upgraded, and 2) Enviromine has been installed, which adds in various additions like thirst, sanity, and physics. The first day it will be critically important to get your basic tools, some torches, and a stable home.

You are going to start off with Flint tools, as you cannot make wooden or cobble tools in this new world.  You need to find Flint to create the heads of your tools, as well as the knife if you want to protect yourself.  Getting flint just means finding gravel, which isn't too difficult.  You will need 1 piece to make a pickaxe, and then more to repair it as you level your pickaxe up. Remember, you will need to make the stencils, tables, and tool stations as the traditional crafting recipes will not work any longer.
