STHCraft: Unremembered Empires
===============

The world has failed. Not with a bang. Not with a whimper. Not even with a sigh. With a shrug of apathy the world has turned its back and slept until it died. Unnoticed by the universe but mourned by a few. We few. The morals. The meek. The explorers. And in noticing that death we have risen a new world from the old.

Some of what was lost has been found. Some new ideas have been brought forth from the aether. Some things wait to be found again. By you, our intrepid industrious individuals! You are the heart of this world. Your feet are the staccato beat of this world's pulse. Your pick axe blows are the clarion call that awaken this world.

Welcome to the new World! Kadath! A new dream that we will all share and shape! Your future has arrived, are you ready to go?
